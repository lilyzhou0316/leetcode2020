/*
 * Given two strings  s  and  t , determine if they are both one edit distance apart.

Note: 

There are 3 possiblities to satisify one edit distance apart:

Insert a character into  s  to get  t
Delete a character from  s  to get  t
Replace a character of  s  to get  t


Example 1:

Input: _s_ = "ab", _t_ = "acb"
Output: true
Explanation: We can insert 'c' into _s_  to get  _t._


Example 2:

Input: _s_ = "cab", _t_ = "ad"
Output: false
Explanation: We cannot get _t_ from _s_ by only one step.


Example 3:

Input: _s_ = "1203", _t_ = "1213"
Output: true
Explanation: We can replace '0' with '1' to get  _t._
