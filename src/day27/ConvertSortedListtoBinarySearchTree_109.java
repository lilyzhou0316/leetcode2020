/*
 * Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending
 *  order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in 
which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example 1:

Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown 
height balanced BST.


Example 2:

Input: head = []
Output: []


Example 3:

Input: head = [0]
Output: [0]


Example 4:

Input: head = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 104].
-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
